FairTrack – Career Fair Companion App

FairTrack is a mobile app built to help students stay organized during career fairs. Instead of juggling business cards, messy notes, and scattered follow-ups, FairTrack puts everything in one place. It makes the career fair experience simple, fast, and stress-free.

🚀 What the App Does

FairTrack helps you:

Scan recruiter QR badges to instantly save their info

Add notes about conversations you had

Track companies, roles, and who you talked to

Set reminders for follow-up emails

Keep everything in one clean dashboard

The goal is simple:
No more forgetting recruiters, losing notes, or missing follow-ups.

🧠 Why I Built It

As a student attending multiple career fairs, I realized:

It’s hard to remember each recruiter

Everyone hands out the same flyers

Follow-up emails get messy

Networking becomes overwhelming

So I built a tool that I wish existed — something that makes career fairs easier and helps students build real connections.
